# tic-tac-toe-deep-q-learning

A tic-tac-toe playing AI bot that learns by playing games.

The model is made using Python and PyTorch. It works on the concepts of DeepQLearning.

I don't remember the accuracy, loss or the win/loss ratio that the model is performing but I will be updating it soon.

Happy playing :)
